== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1) How many notifications can I create?
With the free version you can create 3 different notifications

2) Is the iming interval fixed or randomized?
Randomized. Once you provide a time range in seconds for a notification, we randomly select the variables and timing so that
it looks reals.

For eg, if you provide a time range of 60 secs to 600 secs for a notification, that notification will be randomly displayed between
60 to 600 seconds.
